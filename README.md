# My personal website

I decided to create my own personal website to showcase more about what I’ve done and am currently doing in my life.
Going beyond my CV, this website provides a more detailed showcase of my education, experience and projects that I’m working on, as well as information on how to get in touch with me.


I used `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` to build the website, with elements of Bootstrap (the navbar and cards in particular) to help me design the website with a clean and elegant aesthetic.
Minimalistic icons and full colour images were used to provide an immersive home page, and colour coordination is used throughout the site to provide a smooth flow between cards and matching sections.
