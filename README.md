# Personal Website

I decided to create my own personal website to showcase more about what I’ve done and am currently doing in my life.
Going beyond my CV, this website provides a more detailed showcase of my education, experience and projects that I’m working on, as well as information on how to get in touch with me.

I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build the website, designing it with a clean and elegant aesthetic in mind.
Minimalistic icons and full colour images were used to provide clear pages, and colour coordination is used throughout the site to provide a smooth flow between each section.

* **Bootstrap**: I used the navbar, grid systems and certain style elements within the Bootstrap library.
* **Hamburgers**: I used this code to add animated hamburger icons to pages when on an small screen in the navigation bar.
* **Google Fonts**: I used Open Sans, Lobster and Quicksand as my primary fonts on the website.
* **Font Awesome**: I used the free minimalistic icons available, primarily on the home page.
