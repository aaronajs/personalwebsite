				<!-- REASON -->
				<div class="controlledpadding container crushed">
					<h4 id="reason"><i class="fas fa-book-open fa-lg"></i> The Reason</h4><hr class="border-theme" width="30%" align="left"><br />
					<p>	I spent 2020 completing my degree and looking for my first real job. 
					This pandemic made that far more difficult as my first choice graduate scheme went silent during the first lockdown. 
					I withdrew my application in October, following which they sent me a generic rejection email. 
					This was frustrating as it meant I had to start over. 
					I pushed forward with my job search, resulting in an offer from my dream company in February.</p><br /><br />

						</div>
					</div><br /><br />
					<p>	But the reason I am writing this is to acknowledge that my initial job search wasn't productive. 
						I had weak cover letters, limited interview practice and minimal experience. 
						While I was fortunate to receive three offers during my job search, I applied to over 100 different roles before reaching this point. 
						Many companies sent instant rejections or didn't respond to me at all. </p>
					<br /><hr class="border-theme">
					<h5 class="text-theme">Some stats on my job search</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>I made 103 job applications in total.</li>
						<li>Only 31 companies considered my application past the initial stage.</li>
						<li>I was interviewed 17 times overall (excluding coding and prerecorded video interviews).</li>
						<li>I reached the final interview stage 6 times.</li>
						<li>I received 3 offers.</li>
					</ul><hr class="border-theme"><br />
					<p>	It took me a while to refine my process, which I did by finding helpful resources online.  
						I've benefitted immensely from those who were generous enough to share what they know.
						So I'd like to do the same and pay it forward. </p>
					<p>	However, I'm not an expert. I'm not qualified to tell anyone how they should acquire their first or even dream job. 
						Instead, I'd like to show you every resource I used as they were made by those able to help, with a few common tips included too. 
						These resources cover how to find jobs, apply to them, and improve interview technique. </p>
					<p>	To those of you reading this, I hope you find it helpful. 
						If you want to discuss this more, feel free to <u><a class="text-theme" href="#contactme">reach out</a></u> :)</p>

				<!-- SEARCH -->
				<div class="controlledpadding container crushed">
					<h4 id="search"><i class="fas fa-search fa-lg"></i> The Search</h4><hr class="border-theme" width="30%" align="left"><br />
					<p> I'm sure that many of you can find job postings easily. 
						However, I've added this section if you're still struggling to find them. 
						They can be found directly on a company website if you have particular ones in mind, but it's ideal to search through roles that are relevant to you. </p>
					<br /><hr class="border-theme">
					<h5	class="text-theme">General search tips</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Using a spreadsheet helps to keep track of the roles you are interested in and the stages you reach in each process.</li>
						<li>Keep your information online up to date with detailed and relevant information – recruiters can find you too.</li>
						<li>Be proactive – you should still apply to roles even if you're already at an interview stage.</li>
					</ul><hr class="border-theme"><br />
					<p>	Whether you're looking for graduate roles or positions that require specific technologies, the resources below are excellent for finding jobs that suit you. </p>
				</div><br /><br /><br />

				<!-- APPLICATION -->
				<div class="controlledpadding container crushed">
					<h4 id="applications"><i class="fas fa-list-ul fa-lg"></i> The Application</h4><hr class="border-theme" width="30%" align="left"><br />
					<p>	As I mentioned earlier, it took me a while to improve the applications I made. 
						The process won't be the same for everybody but making a good first impression helps.
						Many companies screen their applicants using an automated system (<u><a class="text-theme" href="https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/what-is-an-ats-resume">ATS</a></u>), so it can help to make sure your CV is machine readable too.
						I've listed three tips below, with some resources to help research roles and improve CVs and cover letters. </p>
					<br /><hr class="border-theme">
					<h5 class="text-theme">General application tips</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Know the company and role: who they are, what you will do, company values, recent news, etc.</li>
						<li>Tailor your cover letter (and where needed your CV) to the role.</li>
						<li>Reflect and adapt: if you're instantly rejected or ghosted, something might need to change. Try to get feedback, although not many companies provide it at this stage.</li>
					</ul><hr class="border-theme"><br />
				</div><br /><br /><br />

				<!-- INTERVIEWS -->
				<div class="controlledpadding container crushed">
					<h4 id="interviews"><i class="fas fa-handshake fa-lg"></i> The Interviews</h4><hr class="border-theme" width="30%" align="left"><br />
					<p> Getting to this stage is an achievement itself. 
						Depending on the role you applied for, there can be a whole range of interviews and assessments. 
						I received my offer after eight interviews. 
						These interviews can be carried out separately or at an onsite / assessment centre. </p>
					<p>	The sources below focus on three different types of interview which I've marked with tags. 
						These are behavioural and competency-based interviews, live coding and whiteboarding interviews, and system design interviews. 
						Many of these sources are relevant for take-home tests and coding challenges. 
						All of them are free or have a free trial. </p>
					<br /><hr class="border-theme">
					<h5	class="text-theme">General interview tips</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Improving your technique will help more than memorising solutions and answers.</li>
						<li>Practice as much as possible, even interviewing at companies you're not that interested in can be good practice for you.</li>
						<li>Most interviewers are on your side. It can be easier to treat it as a conversation.</li>
					</ul><hr class="border-theme"><br />
				</div><br /><br /><br />

				<!-- MENTAL HEALTH -->
				<div class="controlledpadding container crushed">
					<h4 id="mental"><i class="fas fa-heart fa-lg"></i> Mental Health</h4><hr class="border-theme" width="30%" align="left"><br />
					<p>	If you're neurotypical or uncomfortable talking about mental health, feel free to scroll on! 
						But if you're more neurodiverse, like me, or merely curious, I've added this section specifically for you. 
						I could go on and on about the stigma around mental health or its importance in modern society. 
						Instead, I'd like to be direct. </p>
					<p>	Having companies go back on their word, being suddenly ghosted by them, and the numerous application processes took a toll on my mental health — stress, anxiety and depression (SAD). 
						These consequences are increasingly common. 
						So if you're searching for a job and feel SAD, the resources below may help. 
						It's ok to feel SAD, but it can be better to acknowledge this or even attempt to heal. </p>
					<p>	You are more important than any job out there :)</p>
