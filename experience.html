					<p> I work with two other fellow university students as an Ambassador to JobLab.
              JobLab is a London based startup company that aims to make the process of applying for internships and grad jobs easier, particular with other startup companies. <br /><br />
              My role mainly consists of promoting the company, it’s practices and platform to other students at my university.
              I do this both online through social media such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and LinkedIn, and also in person.
              I manage stalls at various different campuses in the university and inform students about the service JobLab provides, answering any questions they may have whilst encouraging them to signup. </p>

					<h3 class="text-nota attention">Co-Founder, Developer and Designer</h3>
					<p> Along with a school colleague, I started a business that aimed to provide a new digital and hybrid format of a textbook and revision guide app for GCSE students for mathematics and the three sciences.
              Our plan was to begin with these subjects then expand to a wider variety. <br /><br />
              We aimed to create a textbook that could be accessed by students on any device.
              The textbook would be refined to omit common errors seen in most books today and take advantage of technology that was already available to consumers.
              From utilising Apple’s “Handoff” features to ensure fluid revision between multiple devices to using augmented and virtual reality headsets to provide detailed three-dimensional diagrams. <br /><br />
              I created the website for our company and carefully designed the textbooks, diagrams and official media for use in advertising.
              I helped to create our online presence by using both search engine optimisation and through social media.
              I gained experience with Amazon Web Services, Adobe Photoshop and Pixelmator through this.
              I also presented to groups of over 200 people at schools to talk about our product and conducted public surveys across Manchester City Centre. </p>

          <p> I worked with several of the employees on their projects including creating presentations and carrying out inventory checks.
              I also had the opportunity to carry out tasks with more sophisticated equipment including a 3D printer and a laser cutter. <br /><br />
              I was also responsible for part of the campus wide inventory checks for the department, ensuring that all pieces of equipment were encountered for.
              The process involved comparing data of over a thousand different items.</p>
