					<h4 class="text-theme"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Introduction</h4><hr class="border-theme" width="30%" align="left">
					<p>	I spent 2020 completing my degree and looking for my first real job. 
					This pandemic made that far more difficult as my first choice graduate scheme went silent during the first lockdown. 
					I withdrew my application in October, following which they finally responded by sending me a generic rejection email. 
					This was incredibly frustrating as it meant I had to start my search from scratch. 
					However, I pushed forward and ended up receiving a much better offer from my dream company in February.</p><br /><br />
					<div class="flex-parent">
						<div class="input-flex-container">

						</div>
					</div><br /><br />
					<p>	But the reason I am writing this is to acknowledge that my initial job search wasn't productive. 
						I had unconvincing cover letters, limited interview practice and minimal experience. 
						While I was fortunate to receive three offers during my job search, I applied to over 100 different roles before reaching this point. 
						Many companies sent instant rejections or didn't respond to me at all. </p>
					<br /><hr class="border-theme">
					<h5 class="text-theme">Some stats on my job search</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>I made <b><span class="text-theme">103</span></b> job applications in total.</li>
						<li>Only <b><span class="text-theme">31</span></b> companies considered my application past the initial stage.</li>
						<li>I was interviewed <b><span class="text-theme">17</span></b> times overall (excluding coding and prerecorded video interviews).</li>
						<li>I reached the final interview stage <b><span class="text-theme">6</span></b> times.</li>
						<li>I received <b><span class="text-theme">3</span></b> offers.</li>
					</ul><hr class="border-theme"><br />
					<p>	It took me a while to refine my process, which I did by finding helpful resources online.  
						I've benefitted immensely from those who were generous enough to share what they know.
						So I'd like to do the same and pay it forward. </p>
					<p>	However, I'm not an expert. I'm not qualified to tell anyone how they should acquire their first or even dream job. 
						Instead, I'd like to show you every resource I used as they were made by those able to help, with a few general tips included too. 
						These resources cover how to find jobs, apply to them, and improve interview technique. </p>
					<p>	To those of you reading this, I hope you find it helpful. 
						If you want to discuss this more, feel free to <u><a class="text-theme" href="#contactme">reach out</a></u> :)</p>

					<p> I'm sure that many of you can find job postings easily. 
						However, I've added this section if you're still struggling to find them. 
						They can be found directly on a company website if you have particular ones in mind, but it's ideal to search through roles that are relevant to you. </p>
					<p>	Whether you're looking for graduate roles or positions that require specific technologies, the resources below are excellent for finding jobs that suit you. </p>
					<br /><hr class="border-theme">
					<h5	class="text-theme">General Search Tips</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Using a spreadsheet helps to keep track of the roles you are interested in and the stages you reach in each process.</li>
						<li>Keep your information online up to date with detailed and relevant information so recruiters can find you too.</li>
						<li>Be proactive: you should still apply to roles even if you're already at an interview stage with another company.</li>

					<p>	As I mentioned earlier, it took me a while to improve the applications I made. 
						The process won't be the same for everybody but making a good first impression helps.
						Many companies screen their applicants using an automated system (<u><a class="text-theme" href="https://www.topresume.com/career-advice/what-is-an-ats-resume">ATS</a></u>), so it can help to make sure your CV is machine-readable too.
						I've listed three tips below, with some resources to help research roles and improve CVs and cover letters. </p>
					<br /><hr class="border-theme">
					<h5 class="text-theme">General Application Tips</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Know the company and role: who they are, what you will do, company values, recent news, etc.</li>
						<li>Tailor your cover letter (and your CV where needed) to the role.</li>
						<li>Reflect and adapt: if you're instantly rejected or ghosted, something might need to change. Try to get feedback from people you trust.</li>

				<div class="controlledpadding container crushed" id="interviews"><br /><br />
					 <h4 class="text-theme"><i class="fas fa-handshake"></i> The Interviews</h4><hr class="border-theme" width="30%" align="left">
					<p> Getting to this stage is an achievement itself. 
						Depending on the role you applied for, there can be a whole range of interviews and assessments. 
						How many you do depends on the nature of the role.
						I received my Apple offer after eight interviews but for my internship, I was only interviewed three times.
						These interviews can be carried out individually or at an onsite / assessment centre. </p>
					<p>	The resources below focus on three different types of interview. 
						These are behavioural and competency-based interviews, live coding and whiteboarding interviews, and system design interviews. 
						Many of these resources are relevant for take-home tests and coding challenges. 
						All of them are free or have a free trial. </p>
					<br /><hr class="border-theme">
					<h5	class="text-theme">General Interview Tips</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Improving your technique will help more than memorising solutions and answers.</li>
						<li>Practise as much as possible; even interviewing at companies you're not that interested in can be good practice for you.</li>
						<li>Most interviewers are on your side. It can be easier to treat it as a conversation.</li>
						<li>It's (usually) your choice of language. A slow but correct, 2 line Python solution is probably better than a complex and incorrect 50 line C++ solution.</li>
